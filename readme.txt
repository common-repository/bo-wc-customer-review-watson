#### What is IBM Watson, what is Tone Analyzer?


We rely on IBM Watson as a pioneer system of cognitive computing to give you the power of artificial intelligence in your content. Thanks to the ability of IBM Watson to understand unstructured data (which is type of data we use to communicate as humans) you can get accurate insights about your content and know how it will be perceived by other humans.

[IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson) is the Artificial  Intelligence Branch of IBM, proposing a lot of A.I. different services for different needs

[IBM Watson Tone Analyzer](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/tone-analyzer/) is the Watson service, that understand emotions and communication style in text.
Base on this it can return a list of emotions/tones detected eventually in your text, with a % of fiability.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= VERSION OLDER THAN 1.0 > HOW TO UPDATE MY PLUGIN FREE VERSION TO A NEW VERSION? =

Only for versions up to 0.9.7:
It could happend, in some cases, with the Free version licence, that the free license could be not well activated or blocked,  you could be blocked to get an access to the plugin update. In this case:<
1. It should be possible to go to wp-admin/admin.php?page=bo-customer-review-watson-account and do "sync" licence,.
2. If not working, you can redownload again the last version and upload it again. Don't worry no data will be lost.
3. If not possible in your case, the best to do is to contact us and we will generated a new licence remotely and it should be possible to sync the licence,  or try "Activate licence" with the one we will send to you.

= Do you have a paid version? =


We're currently working on it. It will have more features.
See the [premium page on our site](https://wc-reviews-watson-tone-analyzer.blue-origami-digital.com/pro)
[Subscribe](https://wc-reviews-watson-tone-analyzer.blue-origami-digital.com/contact/) to our mailing list to be the first to know before we launch it.


= What languages are available? =


The plugin interface is in English and French, because Watson API is currently only working for French and English. As soon as Watson will upgrade, we will adapt.
A pro version will anyway provide a Back Office admin version with some more languages for the uUser Interface, but the Tone analyzis service will still only be able to manage French & English.
